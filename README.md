Quest is an innovative AI-powered app that recommends new experiences for users to try out in their local area.
It analyzes various aspects of their personality and interests, such as hobbies, preferences, and past experiences, to curate a personalized list of local adventures. 
Whether it's discovering a new cafe, embarking on an outdoor adventure, or attending a cultural event, Quest helps users step out of their comfort zones 
and explore their city like never before.

Quest was built using React Native for a responsive and cross-platform mobile experience. We harnessed GPT-3.5 to provide personalized recommendations, employing
its language generation capabilities to analyze user inputs and curate unique adventure suggestions. The development process included data integration, algorithm training,
and a strong focus on data privacy and security. This fusion of React Native and GPT-3.5 allowed us to create an innovative app that redefines local 
exploration with AI-powered personalization.
